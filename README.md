## 🍳 Personal Blog Project

This is a blog I designed and developed from scratch, as part of practicing my web development skills.  
The content is currently focused on **cooking**, but the goal was to build a complete and responsive blog layout.  
It's a real project that shows my frontend structure, layout organization, and styling.
